I offer services related to supply chain security. <br>
Currently I work with 
 [Bom Resolver](https://bomresolver.io)
<br>
<br>
The name indicates that the software supply chain is backtracked. 


- Rapid prototyping with Alpine packages. 
- Coordinate metadata from packages with build manifests.
- Download all software, analyze and rebuild. 
- Back where you started, but with trusted binaries from a airgapped build system
