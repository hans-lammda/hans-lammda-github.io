I offer services related to supply chain security. <br>
Currently I work with my own project <A HREF="https://bomresolver.io">Bom Resolver</A>. 
<br>
<br>
The name indicates that the software supply chain is backtracked. 
<ul>
  <li>Rapid prototyping with Alpine packages. 
  <li>Coordinate metadata from packages with build manifests.
  <li>Download all software, analyze and rebuild. 
  <li>Back where you started, but with trusted binaries from a airgapped build system
</ul>
