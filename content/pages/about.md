> "What you do not understand you can not make secure"

# Challenge 
If the average software product contains 100 open source projects, and each project contains 1000 files the ambition to understand is a challenge. 

# How
## Eyeballs 
With wide adoption of open source comes many eyeballs that review the code 
## Automation 
CI/CD built not only for deployment of software, but also for creating evidence of compliance 
## Artifical intelligence 
AI depends on data quality delivered from automation
