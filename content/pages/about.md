> "What you do not understand you can not make secure" 


 
The above statement comes with challenges. Lets assume 
- One Products depends on ten components 
- Components contains someone elses code ( FOSS project  ) 
- Each component contains 100 Foss projects 
- Each such project contains 1000 files 
- Each file contains 1000 line of code 

I am recently assigned to lead the security supply chain on behalf of  [Cybernode.se](https://cybernode.se)

We cannot expect one individual to understand large software project we must collaberate 

- Educate 
- Automate 
- Delegate 


Very few people actually use the source code, instead binary versioned provided by aggregators such as 
- Redhat 
- Debian 
- Suse 
- Alpine 

I contribute to open source with [Bom Resolver](https://bomresolver.io) enabling you to backtrack a binary to the project.
