> "What you do not understand,  you can not make secure" 


 
The above statement comes with challenges. Lets assume 
- One Products depends on ten components 
- Components contains someone elses code ( FOSS project  ) 
- Each component contains 100 Foss projects 
- Each such project contains 1000 files 
- Each file contains 1000 line of code 

I am recently assigned to lead the security supply chain on behalf of  [Cybernode.se](https://cybernode.se)

We cannot expect one individual to understand large software project we must collaberate 

- Educate 
- Automate 
- Delegate 


Very few people actually use the actual source code, instead the use the binary version provided by aggregators such as 
- Redhat 
- Debian 
- Suse 
- Alpine 

I contribute to open source with [Bom Resolver](https://bomresolver.io) enabling you to backtrack a binary via tools all the way to the project hosting the actual source. 

Starting from the binary the complete and final SBOM could then be used to retrieve all source for rebuilding the binary.
